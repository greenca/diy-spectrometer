    <h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>In this project we show how easy and inexpensive it is to assemble an instrument that analyzes the spectrum of light either absorbed by or emitted flourescently from a sample.  Several applications of this instrument will be demonstrated as part of the exhibit and include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Detecting of crude and other oil-based contaminants in water samples</li>
<li>Presence of pollutants such as pesticides and other chemicals</li>
<li>Analysis of food and beverages</li>
</ul>
<p>The center-piece of the exhibit is a benchtop system where all the components of spectrometer are clearly laid out.  A notebook computer will allow interactive viewing of the spectra, and a selection of different samples will be available for analysis.</p>
<p>Areas of software experimentation include the automatic matching of spectra to known substances.  Areas of hardware experimentation include more portable versions of a spectrophotometer and enhancements to the optical layer (such as extending range into near UV and near infrared).   Prototype stage work in these areas of software and hardware experimentation will be available to supplement the main exhibit. </p>
<p>Our main motivation for this exhibit is to share and connect with other makers interested in building instruments and systems that help citizens and communities understand their exposure to harmful substances in the environment.</p>
